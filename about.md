I am an Aerospace Engineer with a career focus in guidance, navigation, and control of aerospace systems. My focus areas include tactical missile GN&C, modeling and simulation, and statistical data analysis for engineering applications, but I also take in significant interest in autonomous systems, machine learning, and statistics.

This page is intended to serve as a medium to write about various GN&C topics, homework problems, and general engineering applications of interest, as well as a personal code respository.
