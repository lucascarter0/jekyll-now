### Problem 2.17:

  Suppose that the number of calls per hour to an answering service follows a Poisson process with rate 4. \\
   a.) What is the probability that fewer (i.e., $<$) than 2 calls came in the first hour? \\
   b.) Suppose that 6 calls arrive in the first hour, what is the probability there will be $<$ 2 in the second hour. \\
   c.) Suppose that the operator gets to take a break after she has answered 10 calls. How long are her average work periods? 

##### Part a)
Let $X ~ Poisson(4)$ be the number of calls per hour. Then
$$ \begin{gather*}
    P(X < 2) = P(X=0) + P(X=1)
    P(X < 2) = e^{-4}\frac{4^0}{0!} + e^{-4}\frac{4^1}{1!}
    = 5e^{-4} \approx 0.0916
\end{gather*} $$

##### Part b)

Due to the memoryless property of Poisson,

$$ \begin{gather*}
    P(X_2 < 2 | X_1 = 6) = P(X < 2) \approx 0.0916
\end{gather*} $$

##### Part c)
Mean value of Poisson($\lambda$) = $\lambda$ \\
$E[X] = 4$ calls per hour, or 0.25 hours per call. \\
0.25 hours/call multiplied by 10 calls = 2.5 hours
