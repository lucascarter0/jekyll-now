title: Example of Sufficient Statistic
permalink: /homework/
---

The following problem deals with the concept of sufficiency when finding meaningful statistics for a set of data. 

First, a quick refresher on sufficiency. For a random variable, a statistic is sufficient if it captures all information about  the parameter(s) that characterize the random variable. More formally:
> For a random vector $\textbf{X}$ with parameter $\theta$, a statistic $T$ is sufficient if the conditional distribution of $\textbf{X}$ given $T$ is free of $\theta$, meaning the conditional distribution of $\textbf{X}$ given T is completely known. 

This becomes useful when constructing estimators, and in hypothesis testing, as it allows for a significant reduction in data. I won't elaborate on that here - the problem simply illustrates finding sufficiency for a "non-normal" random variable.

From Statistical Inference, Casella and Berger, Second Edition. Problem 6.16:
> A famous example in genetic modeling (Tanner, 1996 or Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) is a genetic
linkage multinomial model, where we observe the multinomial vector $(x1,x2,x3,x4)$ with cell probabilities given by $(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\theta}{4},\frac{1}{4}(1-\theta),\frac{1}{4}(1-\theta),\frac{\theta}{4}).
>   a.) Show that this is a curved exponential family.
>   b.) Find a sufficient statistic for \theta.
