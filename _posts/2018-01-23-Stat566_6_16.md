title: Example of Sufficient Statistic
permalink: /homework/
---

The following problem deals with the concept of finding sufficient statistics for a set of data. Sufficiency is rarely needed by itself in application, but it is an important concept that allows for a reduction in data when constructing estimators. While the problem notes that it is a famous example in genetic modeling, the solution is very hard to find online, so I have posted it here for anyone that would like to reference it.

From Statistical Inference, Casella and Berger, Second Edition. Problem 6.16:

  A famous example in genetic modeling (Tanner, 1996 or Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) is a genetic
linkage multinomial model, where we observe the multinomial vector $(x1,x2,x3,x4)$ with cell probabilities given by $(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\theta}{4},\frac{1}{4}(1-\theta),\frac{1}{4}(1-\theta),\frac{\theta}{4})$.  

   1.) Show that this is a curved exponential family.  
   2.) Find a sufficient statistic for $\theta$.  

Instead of solving parts 1 and 2 separately, I will cut to the chase and say that part 2 can be easily solved by proving 1. Showing that this vector is an exponential family is just an exercise in algebra. Using the four cell probabilities above, the multinomial distribution can be constructed as:  
   $$ f(x|\theta) = \frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!x_3!x_4!}(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\theta}{4})^{x_1}(\frac{1}{4}(1-\theta))^{x_2}(\frac{1}{4}(1-\theta))^{x_3}(\frac{\theta}{4})^{x_4} $$

To solve, rewrite the distribution to match the form of an exponential family:  

   $ = \frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!x_3!x_4!}(\frac{1}{4})^{n}(2+\theta)^{x_1}(1-\theta)^{x_2}(1-\theta)^{x_3}\theta^{x_4} $
   $ = \frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!x_3!x_4!}(\frac{1}{4})^{n}\exp\[x_1\log (2+\theta) + x_2\log (1-\theta) + x_3\log (1-\theta) + x_4 \log \theta\] $
   $ = \frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!x_3!x_4!}(\frac{1}{4})^{n}\exp\[(n- x_1 - x_4)\log (1-\theta) + x_1\log(2+\theta) + x_4\log \theta\] $
   $ = \frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!x_3!x_4!}(\frac{1}{4})^{n}(1-\theta)^n\exp\[x_1\log (\frac{2+\theta}{1-\theta})+x_4\log (\frac{\theta}{1-\theta})\] $

Once simplified, it can be seen that this distribution matches the form  
$ f(x|\theta) = c(\theta)h(x)exp\[$\sum_{j=1}^{k} w_j(\theta)T_j(x)\] $  
with
$ c(\theta) = (1-\theta)^n,  h(x) = \frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!x_3!x_4!} $  
$ w_1(\theta) = \log (\frac{2+\theta}{1-\theta}),  T_1(x) = x_1 $  
$ w_2(\theta) = \log (\frac{\theta}{1-\theta}),  T_2(x) = x_4 $

Since $f(x)$ is an exponential family, the statistic $ T(x) = (x_1,x_4) $ is sufficient for \theta.
