title: Example of Sufficient Statistic
permalink: /homework/
---

The following problem deals with the concept of sufficiency when finding meaningful statistics for a set of data. 

First, a quick refresher on sufficiency. For a random variable, a statistic is sufficient if it captures all information about  the parameter(s) that characterize the random variable. More formally:
> For a random vector $\textbf{X}$, a statistic $T$ is sufficient for parameter $\theta$ if the conditional distribution of $\textbf{X}$ given T is completely known. $$ P_{\theta}(\textbf{X} = \textbf{x}|T(\textbf{X}) = T(\textbf{x})) = \frac{P_{\theta}(\textbf{X}=\textbf{x})}{P_{\theta}(T(\textbf{X}=T(\textbf{x}))} \equiv h(\textbf{x})$$, where $h(\textbf{x}) does not depend on $\theta$ and is a known function.

A famous example in genetic modeling (Tanner, 1996 or Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) is a genetic
linkage multinomial model, where we observe the multinomial vector $(x1,x2,x3,x4)$
