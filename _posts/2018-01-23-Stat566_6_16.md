title: Example of Sufficient Statistic
permalink: /homework/
---

The following problem deals with the concept of finding sufficient statistics for a set of data. 

First, a quick refresher on sufficiency. For a random variable, a statistic is sufficient if it captures all information about  the parameter(s) that characterize the random variable. More formally:
> For a random vector $\textbf{X}$ with parameter $\theta$, a statistic $T$ is sufficient if the conditional distribution of $\textbf{X}$ given $T$ is free of $\theta$, meaning the conditional distribution of $\textbf{X}$ given T is completely known. 

Sufficiency is rarely needed by itself in application, but it is an important concept when constructing estimators, as it allows for a significant reduction in data.

From Statistical Inference, Casella and Berger, Second Edition. Problem 6.16:
> A famous example in genetic modeling (Tanner, 1996 or Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) is a genetic
linkage multinomial model, where we observe the multinomial vector $(x1,x2,x3,x4)$ with cell probabilities given by $(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\theta}{4},\frac{1}{4}(1-\theta),\frac{1}{4}(1-\theta),\frac{\theta}{4})$.

>   a.) Show that this is a curved exponential family.
>   b.) Find a sufficient statistic for $\theta$.

Instead of solving a) and b) separately, I will cut to the chase and say that part b) can be easily solved by proving a). Showing the exponential family is just an exercise in algebra.

The multinomial distribution for the four cell probabilities:
$ f(x|\theta) = \frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!x_3!x_4!}(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\theta}{4})^{x_1} $
