title: Example of Sufficient Statistic
permalink: /homework/
---

The following problem deals with the concept of sufficiency when finding meaningful statistics for a set of data. 

First, a quick refresher on sufficiency. For a random variable, a statistic is sufficient if it captures all information about  the parameter(s) that characterize the random variable. More formally:
> For a random vector $\textbf{X}$ with parameter $\theta$, a statistic $T$ is sufficient if the conditional distribution of $\textbf{X}$ given $T$ is free of $\theta$, meaning the conditional distribution of $\textbf{X}$ given T is completely known. 

This is useful when creating an estimator for a random sample, as it allows for a significant reduction in data.  

A famous example in genetic modeling (Tanner, 1996 or Dempster, Laird, and Rubin 1977) is a genetic
linkage multinomial model, where we observe the multinomial vector $(x1,x2,x3,x4)$
